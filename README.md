# microPanzerkampfwagen

In the scope of the Computers discipline we (@fpimenta @ ) had to develop a final project to apply all the knowledge learned during the course. We developed a chipkit UNO32 based Panzer, connected trough bluetooth to an app we developed using MIT App Inventor. The robot also informs it's location via GPS/GSM module.

## The Robot
We used a car kit we had laying around, similar to the one in the image

We powered the car with 3x 18650 batteries and the CHIPkits with a 5V powerbank. Overall, excluding parts used for fixing everything and the chassis itself and some additional circuitry (relay, switches,...), the materials consisted in:

2x L298n motor drivers
4x DC brush motors
1x Servo motor
2x Chipkit UNO32
1x 5V Powerbank
1x HC-06 Bluetooth Module
1x High Voltage Converter
1x SIM808 GSM/GPS module
